= SPEC-001: CombatBalancer - D&D Encounter Simulation Tool
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

Many Dungeons & Dragons players and Dungeon Masters struggle to balance combat encounters that feel challenging but fair. The existing encounter balancing tools (like Kobold Fight Club or official XP-based guidelines) are often too static or misleading. They don’t account for party composition, action economy, or damage variance.

This project aims to build a simulation-based combat balancer that takes in detailed party and monster data, runs thousands of combat simulations, and outputs useful insights: win/loss chances, survivability, suggested adjustments. The goal is to give DMs a data-driven tool to plan better encounters and avoid unintentional TPKs or cakewalk fights.

== Requirements

The system should serve as a combat balancing and simulation tool for Dungeons & Dragons 5e (with potential to extend to other tabletop RPGs). It will take structured input about party configuration and enemy encounters, simulate combat outcomes, and output balance reports.

=== Must Have

- Support tracking and consumption of limited class and item resources

- Accept structured input for party members (class, level, HP, AC, role, base damage, abilities)

- Accept structured input for enemy groups (CR, HP, AC, role, base damage, abilities)

- Simulate multiple rounds of turn-based combat with basic action economy

- Support configurable attack priority per unit (e.g., focus weakest, focus melee, random, retaliate)

- Output key metrics:

  - Win rate (party victory vs. TPK)
  - Average number of rounds
  - Individual character survival rates

- Generate balance rating (e.g., Overpowered, Balanced, Deadly)

- CLI interface to run simulations from config file

- JSON/YAML input format with reusable encounter presets

- Ability to simulate multiple iterations (e.g., 1000 runs per encounter)

- Support for custom monster stats (non-official)

- Role-based targeting strategies (e.g., focus melee, focus ranged, focus support)

- Action logging mode to inspect individual combat runs (for debugging)

- Optional behavior rules per unit to allow dynamic targeting logic (e.g., adapt based on HP, previous damage, team status)

- Abstract simulation of support actions:

  - Buffs (e.g., increase hit chance, AC, or damage temporarily)
  - Heals (e.g., restore HP to allies each round)
  - Crowd control (e.g., chance to deny enemy actions)

- Visual charts for survivability, damage over time

=== Won’t Have (in MVP)

- Full rules engine for all 5e spells/conditions
- Real-time battle UI
- Multi-system support (e.g., Pathfinder)

== Method

The system is designed as a modular, CLI-based Python application with a clear separation between input processing, simulation logic, and reporting. This allows easy extension for future integration with tools like Roll20 or a web interface.

=== Component Descriptions

- **CLI Runner**: Parses CLI arguments and kicks off simulation runs.

- **Config Loader**: Reads and validates user-provided YAML/JSON input files.

- **Parser**: Translates config into internal data models (e.g., Party, Combatant, Encounter).

- **Simulation Engine**: Coordinates iterations of combat simulation, managing rounds and team turns.

- **Combat Resolver**: Executes each turn: target selection, attacks, buffs, heals, and CC.

- **Combatant Model**: Shared data structure representing all units (PCs, NPCs, monsters) in combat. Accessed by both the parser and the resolver.

- **Logger**: Optionally stores detailed round-by-round logs for inspection.

- **Metrics Aggregator**: Computes summary statistics from all simulations: win rate, deaths, average rounds.

- **Chart Generator**: (Optional) Generates visual output using libraries like Matplotlib.

- **Output Writer**: Prints final balance rating and optionally writes results to file.
